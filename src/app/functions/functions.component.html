      <h3>Functions</h3>

      <p>What are functions? Well, in effect, functions are little self-contained programs that perform a specific task, which you can incorporate into your own, larger programs. After you have created a function, you can use it at any time, in any place. This saves you the time and effort of having to retell the computer what to do every time it does a common task, for example getting the user to type something in. </p>

              Using a function
            </mat-panel-title>
          </mat-expansion-panel-header>

          <p>Python has lots of pre-made functions. You can use these pre-made functions right now, simply by 'calling' them. 'Calling' a function involves you giving a function input, and it will return a value (like a variable would) as output. Don't understand? Here is the general form that calling a function takes: </p>

          <strong>Code Example 1 - How to call a function</strong>
          <pre><code>
            {{"function_name(parameters)"}}
          </code></pre>

          <p>See? Easy. </p>

          <p><em>function_name</em> identifies which function it is you want to use. For example, the function raw_input(this function has been renamed to input in Python 3), which will be the first function that we will use. Parameters are the values you pass to the function to tell it what it should do, and how to do it.. for example, if a function multiplies any given number by five, the stuff in parameters tells the function which number it should multiply by five. Put the number 70 into parameters, and the function will do 70Ã—5.</p>

          </mat-expansion-panel-header>

          <p>Well, that's all well and good that the program can multiply a number by five, but what does it have to show for it? A warm fuzzy feeling? Your program needs to see the results of what happened, to see what 70 x 5 is, or to see if there is a problem somewhere (like you gave it a letter instead of a number). So how does a function show what it does?</p>

          <p>Well, in effect, when a computer runs a function, it doesn't actually see the function name, but the result of what the function did. Variables do exactly the same thing - the computer doesn't see the variable name, it sees the value that the variable holds. Lets call this program that multiplies any number by five, multiply(). You put the number you want multiplied in the brackets. So if you typed this: </p>

          <strong>Code Example 2 - Using a function</strong>
          <pre><code>
            {{"a = multiply(70)"}}
          </code></pre>
          <p>The computer would actually see this: </p>

          <strong>Code Example 3 - What the computer sees</strong>
          <pre><code>
            {{"a = 350"}}
          </code></pre>
          <em>Note: multiply() isn't a real function, unless you create it. </em>

                A Calculator Program
            </mat-panel-title>
          </mat-expansion-panel-header>

          <p>Let's write another program, one that will act as a calculator. This time it will do something more adventurous than what we have done before. There will be a menu that will ask you whether you want to multiply two numbers together, add two numbers together, divide one number by another, or subtract one number from another. The only problem is that the raw_input function returns what you type in as a string, whereas we want the number 1, not the letter 1 (and yes, in Python, there is a difference). </p>
          <p>Luckily, somebody wrote the function input (eval(input()) in Python 3), which returns what you typed in to the main program - but crucially, as a number, not a letter. If you type an integer (a whole number), what comes out of input is an integer. And if you put that integer into a variable, the variable will be an integer-type variable, which means you can perform addition, subtraction and other mathematical operations on it. </p>
          <p>Now, let's design this calculator properly. We want a menu that is returned to every time you finish adding, subtracting, etc. In other words, to loop (HINT!!!) while (BIG HINT!!!) you tell it the program should still run.

          We want it to perform an option in the menu associated with the number you enter. That involves you typing in a number (a.k.a. input) and an if loop. </p>
          <p>Let's write it out in understandable English first: </p>

          <strong>Code Example 6 - human-language example</strong>
          <pre><code>{{"
              START PROGRAM
              print opening message
              
              while we let the program run, do this:
                  #Print what options you have
                  print Option 1 - add
                  print Option 2 - subtract
                  print Option 3 - multiply
                  print Option 4 - divide
                  print Option 5 - quit program
                  
                  ask the person what option they want and look for an integer
                  if it is option 1:
                      ask for first number
                      ask for second number
                      add them together
                      display the result on screen
                  if it is option 2:
                      ask for first number
                      ask for second number
                      subtract one from the other
                      display the result on screen
                  if it is option 3:
                      ask for first number
                      ask for second number
                      multiply them
                      display the result on screen
                  if it is option 4:
                      ask for first number
                      ask for second number
                      divide the first by the second
                      display the result on screen
                  if it is option 5:
                      tell the loop to stop
              Display a goodbye message on screen
              END PROGRAM
          "}}</code></pre>

          <p class="instruction">Wow! That is an impressive program! Check out the implemented version in the notebook on the right. Play around with it - try all options, entering in integers (numbers without decimal points), and numbers with stuff after the decimal point (known in programming as a floating point). Try typing in text, and see how the program stops running (That can be dealt with, using error handling, which we can address later.) </p>

              Define Your Own Functions
            </mat-panel-title>
          </mat-expansion-panel-header>

          <p>Well, it is all well and good that you can use other people's functions, but what if you want to write your own functions, to save time, and maybe use them in other programs? This is where the 'def' operator comes in. (An operator is just something that tells python what to do, e.g. the '+' operator tells python to add things, the 'if' operator tells python to do something if conditions are met.) </p>
          <p>This is how the 'def' operator works: </p>
          <strong>Code Example 8 - The def operator</strong>
          <pre><code>{{"
          def function_name(parameter_1, parameter_2):
              {this is the code in the function}
              {more code}
              {more code}
              return {value to return to the main program}
          {this code isn't in the function}
          {because it isn't indented}
          #remember to put a colon ':'' at the end
          #of the line that starts with 'def'
          "}}</code></pre>

          <p>function_name is the name of the function. You write the code that is in the function below that line, and have it indented. (We will worry about parameter_1 and parameter_2 later, for now imagine there is nothing between the parentheses. </p>
          <p>Functions run completely independent of the main program. Remember when I said that when the computer comes to a function, it doesn't see the function, but a value, that the function returns? Here's the quote:

          "To the computer, the variable 'a' doesn't look like 'a' - it looks like the value that is stored inside it. Functions are similar - to the main program (that is, the program that is running the function), they look like the value of what they give in return of running." </p>
          <p>A function is like a miniature program that some parameters are given to - it then runs itself, and then returns a value. Your main program sees only the returned value. If that function flew to the moon and back, and then at the end had: </p>
          
          <strong>Code Example 9 - return</strong>
          <pre><code>
            {{"return 'Hello'"}}
          </code></pre>
          <p>then all your program would see is the string "hello", where the name of the function was. It would have no idea what else the program did. </p>
          <p>Because it is a separate program, a function doesn't see any of the variables that are in your main program, and your main program doesn't see any of the variables that are in a function. For example, here is a function that prints the words "hello" onscreen, and then returns the number '1234' to the main program: </p>

          <strong>Code Example 10 - using return</strong>
          <pre><code>
            {{"# Below is the function
            def hello():
                print ('hello')
                return 1234
            
            # And here is the function being used
            >>>hello()"}}
          </code></pre>

          <p class="instruction">Think about the last line of code above. What did it do? Type in the program (you can skip the comments), and see what it does.</p>
          <!--Only show later
          <p>So what happened? </p>
          <p>when 'def hello()' was run, a function called 'hello' was created When the line 'hello()' was run, the function 'hello' was executed (The code inside it was run) The function 'hello' printed "hello" onscreen, then returned the number '1234' back to the main program The main program now sees the line as 'print 1234' and as a result, printed '1234' That accounts for everything that happened. remember, that the main program had NO IDEA that the words "hello" were printed onscreen. All it saw was '1234', and printed that onscreen. </p>-->

                Passing Parameters to Functions
            </mat-panel-title>
          </mat-expansion-panel-header>
          <p>There is one more thing we will cover in this (monstrously huge) lesson - passing parameters to a function. Think back to how we defined functions:</p>

          <strong>Code Example 11 - Defining functions with parameters</strong>
          <pre><code>
            {{"
            def function_name(parameter_1,parameter_2):
              {this is the code in the function}
              {more code}
              {more code}
              return {value (e.g. text or number) to return to the main program}
            "}}
          </code></pre>
          <p>Where parameter_1 and parameter_2 are (between the parentheses), you put the names of variables that you want to put the parameters into. Put as many as you need, just have them separated by commas. When you run a function, the first value you put inside the parentheses would go into the variable where parameter_1 is. The second one (after the first comma) would go to the variable where parameter_2 is. This goes on for however many parameters there are in the function (from zero, to the sky) For example: </p>

          <strong>Code Example 12 - how parameters work</strong>
          <pre><code>
            {{"
            def funny_function(first_word, second_word, third_word):
              print 'The word created is: ' + first_word + second_word + third_word
              return first_word + second_word + third_word
            "}}
          </code></pre>
          <p>When you run the function above, you would type in something like this: funny_function("meat", "eater", "man"). The first value (that is, "meat") would be put into the variable called first_word. The second value inside the brackets (that is, "eater") would be put into the variable called second_word, and so on. This is how values are passed from the main program to functions - inside the parentheses, after the function name. </p>

                The Final Calculator Program
            </mat-panel-title>
          </mat-expansion-panel-header>
          <p>Think back to that calculator program. Did it look a bit messy to you? I think it did, so lets re-write it, with functions.

          To design - First we will define all the functions we are going to use with the 'def' operator (still remember what an operator is ;) ). Then we will have the main program, with all that messy code replaced with nice, neat functions. This will make it so much easier to look at again in the future. </p>
          <p class="instruction">Check out the implementation in the notebook on the right!</p>
          <p>We defined all our functions at the top. This really isn't part of your main program - they are just lots of little programs, that you will call upon later. You could even re-use these in another program if you needed them, and didn't want to tell the computer how to add and subtract again. </p>
