      <h3> Loops </h3>

      <p>Just imagine you needed a program to do something 20 times. What would you do? You could copy and paste the code 20 times, and have a virtually unreadable program. Or, you could tell the computer to repeat a bit of code between point A and point B, until the time comes that you need it to stop. Such a thing is called a loop. </p>

              While Loops

          </mat-expansion-panel-header>

          <p>The following are examples of a type of loop, called the while loop:</p>

          <strong>Code Example 1 – The while loop</strong>
          <pre><code>{{"
          a = 0
          while a < 10:
          a = a + 1  #alternatively a += 1
          print(a)
          "}}</code></pre>

          <p>How does this program work? Let's go through it in English (this is called <strong><em> pseudocode</em></strong>):</p>

          <strong>Code Example 2 – Plain-language while loop</strong>
          <pre><code>{{"
          'a' now equals 0
          As long as 'a' is less than 10, do the following:
          Make 'a' one larger than what it already is.
          print on-screen what 'a' is now worth.
          "}}</code></pre>

          <strong>Code Example 3 – while loop form</strong>
          <pre><code>{{"
          while {condition that the loop continues}:
          {what to do in the loop}
          {have it indented, usually four spaces}
          {the code here is not looped}
          {because it isn't indented}
          "}}</code></pre>

              For Loops
            </mat-panel-title>
          </mat-expansion-panel-header>

          <p>Another way to iterate through things is by using for loops:</p>

          <strong>Code Example 1 - The for loop</strong>
          <pre><code>{{"
          word = 'hippopotamus'
          for letter in word:
          print(letter)
          "}}</code></pre>
        </mat-expansion-panel>
